  <h1 class="dragscroll">Quick Response – Internship at PWR Studio</h1>

  <h2 class="dragscroll">
    PWR 
  </h2>

  <p>
PWR is run by Rasmus Svensson and Hannah Nilsson.

PWR has been located in different places and are now running their studio in Berlin from a shared office which houses the fashion magazine Sang Bleu, and the people that publish the magazine Novembre. The place is an impeccably clean, neatly refurbished German store. check

The studio have quite some business running. I was amazed to find out how much they manage to do in a team of two. Their work includes but is not limited to web development for artists, research projects and music videos.

<p>
Because of the investigative and speculative basis the studio is founded on, PWR speaks at conferences, festivals and lead workshops and classes on the topics they are interested in. During my time in Berlin they went to speak at a panel discussion on filter bubbles / echo chambers at Impakt festival in Utrecht. They are following their own interests and 

These topics are among others “the present and future of communication systems, (…) crypto-governance and the thermodynamics of info-capital.” 

Current clients: Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst, Niels van Doorn (researcher and assistant professor of New Media at UvA), Yung Lean, Bladee (rappers), Amnesia Scanner (band), Nhu Duong (fashion label), the Research Center for Proxy Politics, Art Resources Transfer and more.

  <h2 class="dragscroll">WORK</h2>

  <p>

Tell: How it went? What you did? What was your contribution?

During my period as an intern at PWR, I have been working on a wide range of projects, with different levels of commitment.

A bigger assignment, that overarched the period I spent in Berlin, was txtblock. Txtblock is a publishing initiative by PWR and it works on the blockchain. Without going too much into technical detail this means the text published on this platform is permanent and unchangeable. I worked on the identity of this concept. This meant thinking of new names, developing the visual language that and creating a visual identity for a web-app. I also made visual responses to what the essence of txtblock is. 

I helped building a range of websites for Art Resources Transfer, RCPP, PL (Platform Labor), Mark Jan van Tellingen.

I designed the website of Holly Herndon (early stage).

I did research on new publishing methods and platforms and applied that to developing txtblock. 

I did Deep Meme Research.

I did the hair of Bladee in a videoclip.

I helped PWR developing their show Streams by making 3D mockups and analyzing webcam footage.

I did development for a chrome-plugin that allows the user to encrypt and decrypt messages on any webpage called Ship Of Fools.

I did some maintenance work on websites PWR made earlier. I ran some errants, camera work.

The assignments were assigned to me through a Google doc titled STUFF 4 MANUS, NEW STUFF 4 MANUS or just directly from Hannah or Rasmus.

  <h2 class="dragscroll">GUIDANCE</h2>

  <p>

Work Meetings, feedback, questions and doubts, how you went along. Difficulties?

Contact via mail was a lot of fun. And besides this they are very professional. I almost never got any requests for work outside of office hours. I always felt comfortable with the working hours. I came into work for four or five days a week from 10:00 until 18:00. Though it was a rigid schedule, it made me realize very well when I was working well and when not.

In general, the guidance was personal and professional. Their assignments were communicated very clearly, whether it was via mail / document or in person. Most times, they gave me concrete jobs, like design a logo for or rate these videos by. Sometimes the assignments were more open, mostly when it was the beginning phase of a project. Often these assignments were researches. What characterized them was that they were always open to detours and ideas from my side.  

One thing that I liked but also had some difficulties with was the fact that there were loads of different assignments. Unfortunately some of them, I have only done some process work on and could not finish them.

Most days started with a short talk about progress and assignment(s) for that day.

I think I got along pretty well. I never had to wait long for a review of my work, if it was necessary. Most of the time I knew exactly what I needed to do. I felt useful and appreciated. I would have loved to stay longer and finish some of the many things that were started while I was there.

  <h2 class="dragscroll">GOALS</h2>

  <p>

Which goals beforehand? What did you learn and why? Which skills have you developed? What did this add to your career as artist /designer? What’s your personal development during the internship?

Research in real-life.

A digital approach to work that makes personal sense.

Working internationally.

“To be precise with an own signature” 

Oh yes, and technically / structurally I have learned a lot. I have learned many new tools and skills related to building websites. I have developed a chrome extension. In the practice of PWR, Rasmus usually uses already existing technologies, tools, and methods and builds on top of that. This approach to the ‘cutting edge technology’ characterizes their studio work, and was something interesting to learn from. Instead of being on the sidelines and passive users of technology, they are always on the forefront, trying to figure out how to use these new technologies and ways of working. I learned a lot about work ethic, or making ethics from their practice. What to prioritize in relation to time and resources, how to manage structures, what is a good interface? Functioning is one, stylistic is second, but no matter how streamlined or rigid this may sound, PWR are always flexible in this, prioritizing style over technology when they deem it necessary, and vice versa.

In my search for a place to work, I was trying a lot of studios abroad. In the process my biggest doubt would be that an international studio might not fit my ‘network’. This turned out not to be a problem at all. In graphic design nowadays it is very easy to work from a distance. In practice, Hanna and Rasmus almost never met clients in real life, rather via Skype, and this is not because they don’t want to but because they have this international network.


PERSONAL (working title)

Had fun? Fits you? Connects with education? What you expected?

Being an intern at PWR has been a great experience. 


CONCLUSION

Advice for others, would you recommend? What does this mean for yer own direction?

What will you focus on moving forward?
